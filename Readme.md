Through this project, I learned a LOT about JavaScript array methods:

slice() → Creates a shallow copy without mutating the original array.

splice() → Mutates the array by adding/removing elements.

reverse() → Reverses the order of array elements.

concat() → Merges arrays.

join() → Combines elements with a chosen separator.

forEach() → Loops through arrays to run a callback function.

map() → Returns a new array after processing each element.

filter() → Returns elements meeting a condition.

reduce() → Reduces an array to a single value.

find() & findIndex() → Finds the first match or its index.

findLast() & findLastIndex() → Finds the last match or its index.

some() → Checks if some elements match a condition.

every() → Checks if all elements match a condition.

flat() → Flattens nested arrays.

sort() → Sorts elements (default is UTF-16 order).

This section opened my eyes to just how powerful array methods can be in real-world projects.
